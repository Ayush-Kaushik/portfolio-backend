# What I am building here

I am building a worker whose purpose is to provide a gateway to gemini ai which has stored my websites information.

so user can query it directly instead of going through website.

For M1, I am focusing on getting the single chat and fine tuning model to produce only content specific to my website.

Also, how to get the website content in a readable format - what is the technology behind ingesting this data for better results.
